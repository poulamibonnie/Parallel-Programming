The computation of wave simulation based on Schrödinger’s equation is a perfect candidate for distributing a linear space to N stripes and each stripe being calculated by independent computing nodes. This is a classic example of data distribution. However, each computing node would require some data from their adjacent ranks to calculate the edges. For this, we can leverage the MPI to exchange boundaries and facilitate all other communications between ranks. The task of printing the simulation is assigned to rank 0 or the master rank. All other ranks(nodes) calculate the simulation for their respective assigned stripe and send this message back to rank 0. Rank 0 then collects all the data and then takes care of the printing process.
